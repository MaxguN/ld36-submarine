				["AD", "Very good, very good…"],
				["CA", "Would you like me to report to you on the weather, Admiral?"],
				["AD", "Your impatience will one day get you into trouble, you little.... But to the point. We have a special mission for you and your crew Captain, one that is quite… unorthodox and as so will require the utmost discretion. Are we clear about this, Captain?"],
				["CA", "With all due respect, Admiral, I have no secret from my crew. It would be unbearable for people who do not trust each other to share the same air for months at a time.  "],
				["AD", "Captain! The Admiralty is aware that the Narwhal and her crew are exceptional."],
				["CA", "...Thank you, Admiral."],
				["AD", "Don’t thank me yet, not until you’ve heard this story… Twenty years ago, the light cruiser Seafox disappeared from its patrol route. "],
				["CA", "I remember having studied the case at the Academy. Appropriated by some XXX pirates, I believe."],
				["AD", "That’s what we thought at the time, and what we still let the public think. But months after, we found a survivor, who had washed up on some deserted island. She was quite traumatized, of course, but… From what she told us, their scientific team had followed a strange signal and had retrieved… An ancient piece of technology. A few days later, something happened. She was not clear about what. All we knew in the end is that the ship and her crew disappeared. "],
				["CA", "What about the… artefact?"],
				["AD", "The surviving officer had been tasked by her captain to guard it, and she succeeded in her mission. Or maybe she was saved by it, it is difficult to say. Our scientific and occult division studied the object for a while, but all they could establish is that it was likely a relic from the /// Empire and incredibly powerful. "],
				["CA", "This is a wonderful tale, Admiral, but I fail to see how…"],
				["AD", "The artefact was deemed so powerful that the Admiralty decided to have it dismantled and hidden. But now…"],
				["CA", "Now that war is almost upon us, the Admiralty want their dangerous gizmo back. Is that it?"],
				["AD", "That’s right. Captain, your orders are to head ////. Patrol the sector and retrieve the seven Golden Beacons that have surfaced. Each holds a piece from the // artefact, protected by a riddle. "],
				["CA", "A riddle? That’s the safety measure you…."],
				["AD", "Don’t ask. This is a dangerous mission. /// ships are patrolling the perimeter. And there’s no telling what will happen once the object is on board."]
